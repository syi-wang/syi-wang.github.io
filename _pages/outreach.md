I helped establish the Joint Program - Applicant and Support Knowledgebase ([JP-ASK](https://mit.whoi.edu/admissions/apply/jp-applicant-support-knowledgebase-jp-ask/)) and served on the executive board from 2019-2022. JP-ASK is a volunteer mentorship program for prospective graduate students to the ocean sciences.
