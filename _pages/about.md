Hello! I am a CIRES postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado - Boulder, working with Antonietta Capotondi, Kris Karnauskas, Sara Sanchez, and Jennifer Kay. My postdoc research is focused on understanding how teleconnections between ocean basins shape tropical climate variability, and how these interactions may be changing under global warming. I am broadly interested in physical oceanography, monsoon dynamics, and low-frequency climate variability. 

I received my Bachelors in Chemistry and Earth Sciences from Columbia University in 2018 and a PhD in Climate Science from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in 2024. Outside of work, I enjoy playing racquet sports, skiing, and biking.
