Hello! I am a CIRES Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Colorado - Boulder, working with [Antonietta Capotondi](https://psl.noaa.gov/people/antonietta.capotondi/), [Kris Karnauskas](https://www.colorado.edu/oclab/kris-karnauskas), [Sara Sanchez](https://www.saracsanchez.com/), and [Jennifer Kay](https://cires.colorado.edu/research-groups/jennifer-kay-group). My postdoc research is focused on understanding how teleconnections between ocean basins shape tropical climate variability, and how these interactions may be changing under global warming. I am broadly interested in physical oceanography, monsoon dynamics, and low-frequency climate variability. 

I received my Bachelors in Chemistry and Earth Sciences from Columbia University in 2018 and a PhD in Climate Science from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in 2024. Outside of work, I enjoy playing racquet sports, biking, and rogue-like video games.
